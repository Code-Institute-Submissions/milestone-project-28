# King Performance Therapy

This is a wesbite for King Performance Therapy which is a Chartered Physiotherapy and Personal Training business located in Balbriggan, Co. Dublin. 

## UX

This website is for any individual who is in pain and/or who wants to get fit and would like a solution to those problems. The individuals can book online for either a Chartered Physiotherapy session or a Personal Training session. 
The "USP" is that physiotherapy and personal training is provided by the same individual in the same location so it is mianly for people who want to remain active in a gym settion while they rehabilitate or work around their current physical impairment.
 
User X = An active individual with knee pain who is unsure what the problem is, how they got the problem and how they can fix it. They srrive at the landing page where they see that Chartered Physiotherapy is available. Unsure if they would like to book straight away
They click into "my services" where they see the price list and click the "more info" button in the physiotherapy box which takes them to a section that explains what physiotherapy is and how it can solve their problem. They see the "book-now" button immediately under that and book a chartered physiotherapy appointment using the cliniko API embedded in the website.

User Y = A new gym goer who wants personal training (PT) by someone who knows exactly what they're talking about. They see the same individual that provides Chartered Physiotherapy is also the personal trainer so they assume that the provider must have the knowledge
necessary to solve this problem for them. They can also learn how how PT can help them and they can book an appointment using the call to action buttons that are available on every page of the website.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Feature 1 - Contact forms are available for users to ask questions regarding the services.

Feauture 2 - A map is available to locate where the business is so local people can see that it is within traveling distance of them.

Feature 3 - A form so the user can request their ideal time to have their appointment

Feature 4 - Links to social media accounts using the social media icons will be available in the header and footer so that individuals can view its social media business pages.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
