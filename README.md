Milestone Project 1 King Performance Therapy
This is a website for a Chartered Physiotherapy and Personal Training business that allows prospects to gather an understanding of the services on offer and to allow them to fill out a form where they can request a specific time for an appointment.

UX

This website is for any individual who is seeking physiotherapy or personal training, as they are in pain or want to get into shape respectively. This website allows each user to learn more about the services on offer and to request a time for the appointment type they would like. The goal is to drive users to "book-now.html" (using call to actions) to fill out this form which will result in a phone call being made to them by the sales/admin team to confirm their booking. 

As a prospective physiotherapy customer, I want to learn more about the product; so I click on services in the navbar or "more info" in the physio card in the services section on the homepage. I read about how Physio can help me with my pain. As I am reading I decide that I need this service which leads me to click on the call to action at the end of the information that leads me to booking.html where I fill out the form and await for my booking to be confirmed.

As a prospective personal training client I read about how this serice may benefit me; I also realised that personal training is provided by chartered physiotherapists so they have to know what they're talking about and they may be able to help me with my chronic back at the same time. I am a bit hesitant to pay for one session as I know this may not be enough but I am delighted to see that there is a special offer on. I click one of the many "book-nows" scattered across the website which leads me to book-now.html where I fill out the booking form and await a phone call.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
